        How The Web Works
      </div>
        <p>
          The web is a series a computers that talk to each other over the network called the internet. When a person visits a website, they are entering a
          <em>HTTP request</em> to a network or servers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The servers find the web adress and send it back to the user where their <em>web browser</em> shows the page on their computers. So for example if i wanted to link to <a href="https://www.att.com">ATT.com</a><br>

        HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents are what you see on your browser. They can have <em>text content</em>
          which describes ""what you see" and <em>markup</em>
          which describes "how it looks".

      Tags and Elements

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           HTML documents contain HTML elements and they tell the browser which element to use by using tags. We use tags to make things <b>bold</b> or to add <em>italics.</em>
          We can also use tags to insert breaks or to format the page on how we want it to look. HTML 5.0 is the language that the web is programmed in today.

        Why Computers are Stupid

        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they are only programmed to do what humans tell them to do.
          This also makes them hard to work with because you have to be very careful about your syntax and go back and debug if you want your software to work correctly.

         HTML Elements can be <b>Inline</b> or <b><em>Block.</em></b> Block elements form invisible boxes around the data inside of them. Inline does not.

        Basics of the Web and HTML

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a series of HTML Documents. We use URL's to access websites today or we can use hyperlinks.

        HTML and Tags
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>
          HTML Markup is made up of tags and each tag has what are known as attributes. 
          For example in a tag attribute- the "a" anchor tag, the attribute is the href point. In a image tag, its the src link.<br> 
          "img" tags are void tags since they dont actually contain content.

        White Space and Block Elements
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description"> 
          <p>
            HTML documents contain white space. In order to break up the white space, you can use a void tag like break or a paragraph tag.
            A break tag is inline, all it does is end a line.
          </p>

          <p> 
            A paragraph tag is a block element- it makes an invisible box around what ever is inside the tags. We will later learn that all webpages are just a series of boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Span and Div are other examples of block and inline elements. Span is inline, div is block. CSS can be added to a span and div element to add style to HTML
          </p>
          <p>
            a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements. p and form are block elements.

        <p>
          Complete HTML Documents must have an open, a head, a body and a close.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Elements are boxes that contain tree like structures.
          HTML and CSS are both programming languages.
          HTML controls the structure of a web page. CSS controls the style of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          When programmers talk about Document Object Model(DOM), they are talking about the tree like structure of a web page, as every page can have multiple elements embedded with styles and other things in them.

        Avoid Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>
          Avoiding repetion is important because it helps you avoid errors.
          If you dont avoid repetition, you will have to do the same thing over and over again as you write your code and that can lead to errors via manual typing or copy/pasting.
        </p>  
        <p> 
          It will also help with consistency because if you wanted things to look the same, it allows you to give a each <em>div</em> the same <em>class</em> and then you can specify that look in just one place.

      <div class="concept-description"> 
          <p>
            All documents should start with a line telling the browser what kind of doctype it is. Usually they are HTML files. <br>
            You should indent when you program so its easier to read your code.

        How CSS Works and How You Use it
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"> 
          <p>
            You can add style without linking to a seperate file by using the style tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping the link seperate keeps the code and style on seperate pages so that it makes it easier to understand and see in web developer tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it helps the programmers avoid repetion. The "C" for cascading is the most important factor for CSS.
          </p> 
          <p>
            CSS determines the style of the webpage you are looking at. It is used to control the look of the page. 
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS can have rules and refereneces for several style sheets.The analogy is to think of it as laws- Federal, State, Municipal and House Laws. In terms of which rule it will use, the most specific rule applies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rule of inheritance applies to CSS. It relies on a ancestor-descendent relationship to operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In CSS, you first must write a selector tag- this defines what element of a page the CSS will apply too.
                <br>
            You can select an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all tags in the sheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            .p {} add style to all paragraphs from example. To add style to a description, you would type <em>.description</em>

        How Do I Get More Specific with CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          In CSS, you need a selector(ex. H1), and you need a rule.<br>
          In the body of that rule you need a "declaration" a "property" and a "value".

        How To Include CSS Styling in my Own Web page
    </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              Method 1- Write CSS in the "head" of you HTML file. This is good for small project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Method 2- Link your HTML to a seperate CSS file. As long as they are saved in the same folder, you style attributes should display with your code. This is better for larger projects as it seperates your style from you code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Method 3- the least recommended is the Style Inline method where you write it inline with your code. This is considered a bad idea since it leads to a lot of repeated code.

        The Box Revisited
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">       
        <p>
          CSS styling follows the BOX model. It contains four distinct pieces
          Margin, Border, Padding and Color
        </p>
        <p>
          All HTML elements are boxes and they are a subset of 4 boxes whom I have labeled above and there are many ways to set the attributes for the boxes.

        </p>
        <p>
          Box positions are also important and you need to understand the code that you write to see how they work. The DIV tag is a block element, so it sets a block around the content. Other tags set different boxes around the content as well

          Eventually, after we code, we will go thru a pattern of Code, Test and Refine.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to build structure into our HTML document and visualize boxes. By adding the correct tags, headers and CSS, our webpage will come to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make sure we are efficient and effective in coding webpages from a design, we should be:
          <ol>
            <li>Looking for Natural boxes</li>
            <li>Looking for repeated styles and semantic benefits</li>
            <li>Writing your HTML</li>
            <li>Apply CSS styles (starting from biggest to smallest)</li>
